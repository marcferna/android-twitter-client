# Google Image Searcher for Android

![Video Walkthrough](demo.gif)

## Features
- User can log in with his/her Twitter account
- User can see username, name, body and relative timestamp for each tweet
- User can configure advance search filters
- User can view more tweets as they scroll with infinite pagination
- User can click a “Compose” icon in the Action Bar on the top right
- User can then enter a new tweet and post this to twitter
- User is taken back to home timeline with new tweet visible in timeline
(All required stories completed)

I'm working on persistence but I don't have it working yet. I'm using a CursorAdapter to
auto-populate the Tweet list view. You can see progress in the [pull request](https://github.com/marcferna/android-twitter-client/pull/1) from the persistence branch.

## Todo
- All the optional use cases

Hours spent: ~5
